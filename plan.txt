with boto3
use ec2 to run the api which outputs video.mp4
use s3 bucket for temp video storage 
make a link to download the video


also containerize 


use ml to get matching word deviation between the 
and correct missinterpreted words 


eg.
"guns for hire"
"guns for wire"



to save space we can over write the og peripheral.mp4 with the stichedvideo.mp4
